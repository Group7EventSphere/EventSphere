Risk Storming was implemented for the EventSphere system to proactively identify, analyze, and mitigate potential security and operational risks from the initial design stages. This collaborative technique allowed our team to systematically examine the system architecture, focusing on potential vulnerabilities related to user roles (Organizer, Admin, Guest, Attendee) and core functionalities such as event creation, ticket purchasing, and user authentication.
